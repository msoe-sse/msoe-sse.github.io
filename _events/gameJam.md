## Game Jam 2019

### What is this event?

A game jam is a competition, a race against the clock, to write a video game in less than 36 hours. You, as an individual or as a team, must submit a complete video game by 11:59 on Saturday night. The only catch is that each submission must adhere to some theme, which will be announced Friday at noon. The contest is divided into two main categories, the hard-core competition and the casual competition.

The casual competition allows each team to use whatever assets the team can get their hands on, in order to complete their game. This may include: code, sprites, audio, and game engines.

The hardcore competition is exactly the same; except, that each team must start from scratch. All art, code, sounds, etc must be made starting from noon on Friday through midnight Saturday. There are exceptions to this rule; you may use software tools to aid you in creating your game. This includes things such as game engines, version control software, etc. 

### When is it?

The competition runs from Friday until Sunday.

The game jam theme will be announced on Friday at noon. At that time, people may sign up as individuals or teams, and hack away at their game until 11:00 on Friday. At that time, final submissions will open for anyone who finished in time to submit their code.
