# Game Jam 2019

## What was this event?

The game jam was a competition, a race against the clock, to write a video game in less than 36 hours. You or your team had to submit a video game by 11:59 on Saturday night. The only catch is that each submission must adhere to the year’s theme. The contest consisted of two main categories, the hard-core competition and the casual competition.

This year’s theme was: Dimensional Disasters!

The subcategories for which prizes have been awarded to are: 

Best Art: Melvin the Duck

Best Story: Flipy the Penguin

Most Creative Interpretation of Theme: Euclid's Dreamland

## Game Jam Overall Retro
The game jam went by in a flash. Nothing compares to the panicked cretive rush you feel after realizing you've wasted hours nitpicking one aspect of your game and only have 6 hours to complete 30% of your game. At the end of your 36 hours, all you can do is do that one final git push as the tears stream down your face. Tears of joy that you finished your project before the deadline, but mixed with tears of mouring your beautiful brain child.

Overall, the event went very well. We had some high quality submissions  which have much promise in their own right. I hope that we can continue developing these games in order to make them even better than their current 36 hour versions.

## Try the games for yourself

If you want to try out the first level go to [https://github.com/MsoeGameJam2019](https://github.com/andy-wojciechowski/MsoeGameJam2019). You will need Python installed on your computer and no-one has successfully gotten it to run at the command line yet. The only way to play the game currently is with the PyCharm IDE.

#### Christian Hennig - Flippy the Penguin

Flippy's life was great, until one day everything turned upside down (literally!). "Flippy" is a 2D top-down adventure game inspired by pretty much any good 2D game you can think of. The first level of "Flippy" features bottle whacking, belly-sliding, a mysterious villain, and a copious amount crabs.
