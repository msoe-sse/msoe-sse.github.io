## What is this event?

A game jam is a competition, a race against the clock, to write a video game in less than 36 hours. You or your team must submit a video game by 11:59 on Saturday night. The only catch is that each submission must adhere to the year’s theme. The SSE website will announce the theme on Friday at noon. The contest consists of two main categories, the hard-core competition and the casual competition.

This year’s theme is: Dimensional Diasters!

The subcategories for which we will award prizes are:

Best Art

Best Story

Most Creative Interpretation of Theme

## Rules for the Casual Competion

The casual competition allows each team to use whatever assets the team can get their hands on to complete their game. This may include: code, sprites, audio, and game engines. The game should still be original to this competition and not reusing old projects from the past as submissions. Old assets are always ok to reuse.

## Rules for the Hardcore Competition 

The hardcore competition is exactly the same; however, each team must start from scratch. From the time the competition starts on Friday, until it ends on Saturday each team must produce all submitted art, code, sounds, etc. There are exceptions to this rule; you may use software tools to aid you in creating your game. This includes tools like game engines, version control software, etc.

_Friday at Noon_: The theme will be announced on Friday at noon. All teams may begin developing their games. Make sure to relate the game back to the theme.

## When is it?

The competition runs from Friday at noon until Saturday night.

We will announce the game jam theme on Friday at noon. At that time, people may sign up as individuals or teams, and hack away at their game until the submission window opens at 11:00 pm on Saturday. At that time, final submissions will open for anyone who finished in time to submit their code. Submissions MUST be turned in by the 11:59 deadline.
