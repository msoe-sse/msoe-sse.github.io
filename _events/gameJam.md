# Game Jam 2020

## What was this event?

The game jam was a competition, a race against the clock, to write a video game in less than 36 hours. You or your team had to submit a video game by 11:59 on Saturday night. The only catch is that each submission must adhere to the year’s theme.

This year’s theme was: Out of Control!

## Game Jam Overall Retro
The game jam went by in a flash. Nothing compares to the panicked cretive rush you feel after realizing you've wasted hours nitpicking one aspect of your game and only have 6 hours to complete 30% of your game. At the end of your 36 hours, all you can do is do that one final git push as the tears stream down your face. Tears of joy that you finished your project before the deadline, but mixed with tears of mouring your beautiful brain child.

Overall, the event went very well. We had some high quality submissions  which have much promise in their own right. I hope that we can continue developing these games in order to make them even better than their current 36 hour versions.
