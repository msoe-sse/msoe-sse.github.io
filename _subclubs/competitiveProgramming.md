MSOE's competitive programming club is a place where you can learn not how to program, but how to become a better programmer.

## What do we do?
In Competitive Programming, we learn how to become a better programmer with a few key points. These are what we focus on:
1. Using Logic to build solutions
2. Learning uncommon algorithms to solve problems faster than naive approaches
3. Doing code reviews to identify inefficiencies in programs
We do this in conjunction with competitive programming sites such as [Kattis](https://kattis.com) and [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com), as these have a large variety of pre-existing problems and competitions that we can use to hone our skills.

## What can I achieve in this club?
If you're looking to excel in this, you can strive to be in or replace MSoE's current top team, the [Kotlinaughts](https://codeforces.com/teams/with/sylvyrfysh). They [placed 5th at the ICPC North Central Regional](https://ncna19.kattis.com/standings) this year, qualifying for the [North American Championship](https://nac.icpc.global/) in Atlanta, Georgia. There, they met with top companies such as SpaceX, IBM, and Jetbrains where they discussed internships as well as got a chance to show off their skills. In that competition, they [placed 45th](https://nac.icpc.global/history/2020/scoreboard/), but were competing against the top teams on the continent.
*TODO PICTURE*
However, if you're looking for something more laid back, many people choose to just go to the weekly meetings to pick up new skills or learn about problem solving. There are also many lower profile competitions through the year that you can go to without any pressure, just trying to solve some problems in a fun manner.
