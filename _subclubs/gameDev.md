## Summary
The Game Dev Subclub is for SSE members who are interested in learning more about Game Development. Currently they are working to develop one larger game as a club. Also, the Game Dev club puts together game jams where people compete to develop a game in a limited amount of time and then people vote on which game was their favorite for a chance to win prizes.
