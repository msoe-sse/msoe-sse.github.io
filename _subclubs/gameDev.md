## What's A Game Dev club, and why should I join it?
Well first of all, most people enjoy this strange emtion called joy. If you aren't a fan, then game dev is not for you.

\[Pinky\] So what are we gonna do this year?

\[Brain\] Same thing we do every year Pinky.

1) Meet at least once a week for an hour to hang out, discuss our development projects, and work on our projects.

2) At one point during the year, participate in a game jam!

\[Pinky\] Wow! Game Dev Club sounds so much fun. I'm so glad I joined this year instead of being a total shmuck who misses out on all kinds of fun!

\[Brain\] I know right?!

Why should you join? I guess that's kinda up to you but I can think of some examples. You get to practice your programming design and writing skills. You get to hang out with a cool community of fellow indie developers. Plus you get to meet the president of the club, I hear he's pretty cool.

## Frequently Asked Questions
1) Can I join if I don't know how to code?

Absolutely! We welcome people of all levels of skill in any particular talent. It is generally best if these skills can be applied to game dev. However, it would be cool to have a member who can juggle or ride a unicycle.
Anyways, while coding is an important skill. We would love to teach you what you need to know. Between the two of us though, we generally have more than enough programmers, so join us if you are code literate or illiterate!
	
2) What is a game jam?

Great question! A game jam is a race against the clock to complete an entire game either by yourself or with a team. Each year we pick a new theme the game must follow, at the end of the event everyone chooses their favorite
game and we give prizes to the most popular. Aside from that, there are no rules! (Don't hold me to that)
