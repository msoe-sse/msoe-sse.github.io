## What do we do?
In the Website Subclub, we learn different web development skills by maintaining real websites that are used at MSOE. The Website Subclub maintains this website that you're currently on as well as other projects related to this website. In addition to maintaining the SSE website the Website Subclub also maintains the MSOE Student Government website. All experience levels are welcome where we have are more basic website projects in which we manage basic static content of a site and more advanaced projects in which we make web requests to a RESTful API and fetch data from a database.

## Repositories
