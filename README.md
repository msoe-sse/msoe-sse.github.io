# Setup
1. You will need Ruby 2.4 (NOT 2.5, as we learned)
    - Check version with `ruby -v`
2. We’ll be using git (install if you don’t already have it)
    - For those who are unfamiliar with git & reading these notes in retrospect, please send me a DM and we’ll figure out the best way for you to get comfortable with basic commands or an IDE.
3. Clone the repository
4. Navigate to your project directory in cmd, git bash
5. Run a `gem install bundler`
6. Run a `bundle install`
7. If both (E) and (F) succeed, you’ll be good to run `bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4000` (you don’t need the --port 4000, but this option allows you to specify the port on which the site will run locally for you.
8. You should be able to run the website locally now!
