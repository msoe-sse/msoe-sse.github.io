# It's that time of year again!
SSE Elections are coming up on Friday, February 8th from 12-1 at our Week 9 General Meeting in CC03. If you like SSE and want to be a driving force as we continue thriving and serving the software engineers at MSOE, consider running for one of the 8 positions outlined [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1y8KjkZhdTx65zxQ3nKAFkXkuno39c-I1). 

# So I'm interested. Now what?
We're excited to take on a new chapter with a new eboard, and we hope that you'll consider nominating yourself [here](https://goo.gl/forms/V6td4909MrfYZNix1) if this is something you see yourself doing. We look forward to seeing your nomination!

As always, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to any eboard member over Slack or at our [email](contact@msoe-sse.com).
