# IEEEXtreme

## What is IEEEXtreme?

 IEEEXtreme  is an annual competition programming challenge. The event takes place over a period of 24 hours where teams of IEEE student members compete with each other by solving a series of programming challenges. The competition is being run by the student branch of IEEE at MSOE. To compete in the event you must be a member of IEEE. Registration for IEEEXtreme is currently open. The event will take place on October 19th, the Saturday following week 5. Where the competition will take place has yet to be determined, but it will be some where in Dierks Hall.

## Rules and Other Information

Teams of up to three student IEEE members receive sets of programming problems over 24 hours, starting at 0:00 UTC on the competition date. All teams receive the same problems to solve and are expected to solve the problems without direct outside consultation. Teams don’t need to tackle every problem, but the more they solve, the more points they score. Students submit their solutions using an online tool, which has been HackerRank in recent years. Points are awarded based on how the problem was solved, the time it took, and its difficulty.

## Preparation Workshop with Alumni Connor Hibbs

 Connor is the founder of the competitive programming team and a veteran of IEEEXtreme. He has graciously accepted an invitation to help prepare our members for the event on the October 16th, the Wednesday before the competition. The workshop will take place in Dierks Hall from 6-8pm. Dominoes pizza will be provided through Student Government and Society of Software Engineers. The workshop will consist of a walk through session and a collaboration session for various problems.
