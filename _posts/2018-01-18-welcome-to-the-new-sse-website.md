Originally, the offical SSE website was going to be created using [Angular](https://angular.io/). As time went on, it was clear that the open source blogging platform [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) might be a better choice for SSE.

# What is SSE?

> SSE, or Society of Software Engineers, is the destination organization for software engineers.

We help companies in search of MSOE SE's to take advantage of MSOE's students, and we help students to connect with future employers. SSE sponsers and organizes numerous events throughout the year, and even helps find prospective students for MSOE. Finally, the Society of Software Engineers helps students in the SE, CS and CE majors to connect and collaborate with one another.

# What is in it for me?

As an SSE member, this website will be your hub for all things SSE. From this site you will be able to see calendar events, interesting articles in the world of technology and engineering, and participate in discussion with fellow SSE members.

# Can I help?

Of course! The purpose of this website is to allow students to grow and learn in their programming skills. While some knowledge of [HTML](https://www.w3.org/html/), [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) can come in handy, no prior knowledge is required - we would love to teach you! All SSE website source code and content is available on our [Github](https://github.com/msoe-sse/) repository.
