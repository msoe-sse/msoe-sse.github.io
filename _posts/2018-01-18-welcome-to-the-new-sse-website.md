Originally, the offical SSE website was going to be created using [Angular](https://angular.io/). As time went on, it was clear that the open source blogging platform [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) might be a better choice for SSE.

# What is Jekyll?

> Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.

In other terms, Jekyll is a blogging platform that can be levereged to accomplish many different site goals - and it is open source! This means that SSE can use the platform to build and engaging, informative, and custom website that can be easily programmed by the students of SSE.

# What is in it for me?

As an SSE member, this website will be your hub for all things SSE. From this site you will be able to see calendar events, interesting articles in the world of technology and engineering, and participate in discussion with fellow SSE members.

# Can I help?

Of course! The purpose of this website is to allow students to grow and learn in their programming skills. While some knowledge of [HTML](https://www.w3.org/html/), [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) can come in handy, no prior knowledge is required - we would love to teach you! All SSE website source code and content is available on our [Github](https://github.com/msoe-sse/) repository.
