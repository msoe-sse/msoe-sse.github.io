Welcome to the Winter Quarter of 2022/2023! There's so much that we're looking forward to this term. We cannot wait to work with you to prove that while school here can be hard, it can also be so rewarding and informative. Moreover, the experience is even better with SSE.

We’d love to see you at one of our General Meetings! We will have three total General Meetings this quarter during weeks 2, 5, and 8 during free hour on Fridays. Join us for our first meeting to get free food, hear about our sub clubs, discuss various CS topics, find out about our events, and more! We will be meeting this Friday, December 9th, in DH 310. Can’t wait to see you there!

Want to celebrate before break with friends? Consider popping into our "0 Binary Tree" Holiday Social on Thursday, December 15th, 7pm-9pm in DH 129. Hot cocoa, Christmas cookies, crafts, movie viewing (audience pick), and more will be there!

Following the break, a Resume workshop with NVIDIA prior to the MSOE Career Fair on Thursday, January 5th, 2023 from 5pm-6pm online. At this event, you will be able to gain knowledge on how to best format your resume for success this new year. Not only is this event great for advice, it's good for networking as well. Many have even gotten internships and jobs from SSE events.

Check out our Book Club! Starting on Monday, January 23rd from 6:30pm-8:30pm in DH 310, we will going through Gayle McDowell's "Cracking the Coding Coding Interview" problems. Prepare for your next coding interview with us!

Look forward to our various "Justice In the Galaxy" nights. Together we will craft Star Wars items while discussing how the themes of Star Wars relate to JEDI (Justice, Equity, Diversity, Inclusion). Other JEDI events will include a "Women of EECS Spa Night with SWE", on Thursday, January 19th from 6pm-8pm in DH 310.

Want to start a club but don't know how to get started? Feel that you need resources? Consider starting a SSE sub club! Contact us at admin@msoe-sse.com
