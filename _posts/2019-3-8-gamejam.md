## The What:

A game jam is a competitive race against the clock to formulate a complete video game in less than 36 hours. You, as an individual or as a team, must submit a complete video game by 11:59PM Central Time on Saturday night. The only catch is that each submission must adhere to some theme. The contest is divided into two main categories, the hard-core competition and the casual competition.

 * The casual competition allows each team to use whatever assets the team can get their hands on, in order to complete their game. This may include: code, sprites, audio, and game engines. 

 * The hardcore competition is the same, except that each team must start from scratch. All art, code, sounds, etc. must be created from ground-zero on up, starting noon on Friday through midnight Saturday. There are exceptions to this rule; you may use software tools to aid you in creating your game. This includes things like game engines, version control software, etc. 

## The When:

The game jam theme will be announced on Friday at noon Central Time. At that time, teams and/or individuals may register. Competitors can start hacking away at their game until 11:00 PM Central Time on Friday, when final submissions will open.
