Originally, the offical SSE website was going to be created using [Angular](https://angular.io/). As time went on, it was clear that the open source blogging platform [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) might be a better choice for SSE: Jekyll is eaiser for members to learn, has a faster setup time and is run freely through github.

# What is Jekyll?

> Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.

In other terms, Jekyll is a blogging platform that can be levereged to accomplish many different site goals - and it is open source! This means that SSE can use the platform to build and engaging, informative, and custom website that can be easily updated by the students of SSE.

# What is in it for me?

As an SSE member, this website will be your hub for all things SSE. From this site you will soon be able to see calendar events, posts on current events, pictures of past ones and reference our official guidelines--the SSE constitution.

# Can I help?

Of course! The other purpose of this website is to allow students to grow and learn in their programming skills. While some knowledge of [HTML](https://www.w3.org/html/), [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) can come in handy, no prior knowledge is required - we would love to teach you! All SSE website source code and content is available on our [Github](https://github.com/msoe-sse/) repository, and our meetings are currently held at 6PM in the SDL on Monday nights.
