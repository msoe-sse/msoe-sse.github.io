Here we go again! Nearly summer and already the construction crews are hitting up the roadways.
Allow us some time as we render a better website for you!

Originally, the offical SSE website was going to be created using [Angular](https://angular.io/). As time went on, it was clear that the open source blogging platform [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) might be a better choice for SSE.

# What is the plan?

> To make a better website. How, you ask?

We want a website that helps explain what our org does, and gets our members involved! This isn't a difficult thing to acheive, and we hope our website construction doesn't last long.
So we thank you for your patience as we push forward! To infinity... and beyond!
