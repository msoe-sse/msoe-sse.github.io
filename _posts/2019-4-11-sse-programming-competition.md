## What Is This Event?
The annual SSE programming competition is a chance to use what you have learned in your classes in a more 
“problem solving” oriented series of challenges. Unlike labs which often focus on a product you are implementing, 
this competition presents a series of real world problems and tasks you to solve them using some form of programming. 
Featuring a variety of problems spread over all skills and programming topics, there is something for everyone to enjoy.

**Location:** Cream City Labs in Northwestern Mutual

**Date and Time:** Saturday, May 4th from 9 AM to 5 PM

## What's New This Year?
* The competition this year features 18 new problems (instead of 12). There are six each of easy, medium, and hard 
problems.
* Scoring system has been updated to use the built in HackerRank scoring, so no surprises at the end!
* Location is new at Cream City Labs
