    Hi there! My name is Teresa Toohill and I am the President for SSE. I grew up right here in the Milwaukee area. Because of that, I feel in love with downtown Milwaukee and MSOE. Currently I am a Senior Software Engineering student with an interest in web development, finance, database systems, full stack development, and animation. In my free time I enjoy watching YouTube, Netflix, baking, reading, cooking, and biking. I also dedicate a lot of my time to my sorority, Alpha Omega Epsilon, which works towards diversity in STEM. Feel free to stop me for a chat if you ever want to-- I promise, I don't bite!
