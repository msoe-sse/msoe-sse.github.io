### President - Sabrina Stangler
I'm Sabrina Stangler, I am the President of SSE for the second year in a row, and I'll be a Senior SE for the 19-20 school year. I work at MacGregor Partners as a Product Development Intern, and I have two lovely cats. I really enjoy the requirements gathering process of software projects and designing GUI layouts. I also quite enjoy interacting with databases on the backend, which is not something I've gotten into a lot, but am eager to learn more about.

### View President - Nicholas Scharrer
Hi there, I am Nick Scharrer and an currently the Vice President of SSE. I formerly was the Administrative Coordinator of SSE, and I'm a Senior as of the 2019-20 school year.

I formerly worked at two internship sessions with Collins Aerospace (formerly Rockwell Collins), so have some experience working remotely during the school year. I love learning and working on both the hardware and software side of computing, and really enjoy leading teams!

If you see me walking around, say hi!
