### President - Sabrina Stangler
I'm Sabrina Stangler, I am the President of SSE for the second year in a row, and I'll be a Senior SE for the 19-20 school year. I work at MacGregor Partners as a Product Development Intern, and I have two lovely cats. I really enjoy the requirements gathering process of software projects and designing GUI layouts. I also quite enjoy interacting with databases on the backend, which is not something I've gotten into a lot, but am eager to learn more about.

### View President - Nicholas Scharrer
Hi there, I am Nick Scharrer and an currently the Vice President of SSE. I formerly was the Administrative Coordinator of SSE, and I'm a Senior as of the 2019-20 school year. I work for Intel currently as a co-op in California, but will be back at MSOE full-time in the Fall of 2019. I formerly worked at two internship sessions with Collins Aerospace (formerly Rockwell Collins), so have some experience working remotely during the school year. I love learning and working on both the hardware and software side of computing, and really enjoy leading teams!

I'm eager to learn new technologies but I'm currently focusing on web development, redeveloping games for the old SNES, and participating in National Cyber League competitions. If you see me walking around, say hi!
