# Slack Etiquette
### Aka meming and messaging responsibly - msoe-sse.slack.com
> Few people want constant phone buzzes 

## 1. Unless you are on the executive board, do NOT use @channel in #general or #random under any circumstances
> If you do have something of importance, please message _Brady Cassada_, the Communications Coordinator

## 2. Threads are your friend! They don't clog up the channel, and they keep conversation focused. 
> In your **thread reply**, be sure to **@whoever** you're replying to in the thread otherwise they might not get a notification!

## 3. If you are creating a channel for a small specific group (for example, class project groups), 
> **Make it private.** 
> Or, if the channel is around a particular interest, idea, or topic that you'd like others to get involved in, then consider making it public.
